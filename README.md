# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Environment Setup

Before running the app, you need to set up environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add the following variables:

```bash
# Sentry Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=ht****tps://fc3049277d*********1bf518a27956cc2*********ffc8ad9@o4509786***********

# Supabase Configuration (if needed)
# EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
# EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Other Environment Variables
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url
```

**Note:** The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` for security reasons.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
